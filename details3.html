                Can we completely bypass small talk?
                do we need to talk about the weather before we talk about love?

                    I put it to the test
                    My friend on the left and a complete stranger to both me and her to the rigth,
                        we went to the same school so it was not completely out of the oridnary to ask some 
                              students from a different class to participate in projects like these 
                                       (when I was for one semester in Art Science KABK, den haag, 2018)

              
                                    The instructions,

                                                            go into this small dark closet with no lightsource but a lamp 
                                                    with a stranger, connected by a bedsheet cut with two holes,
                                    and no talking allowed, a camera in the closet, monitor outside for an audience, 
                         not recording, just observing for 10 minutes,
                they didn’t know anything 
        more than these simple instructions.

around the 6 or seven minitue mark they looked at eachother, smiled and laughed, without saying anything, 
they started to play with the lamp, moving it around and eventually turning it off.


when they came out they were told about this idea of overcoming small talk without having to small talk
they seemed friendly and more at ease, they talked together after the performance as friends, 
not strangers.
