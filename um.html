If you wake up and the day feels a-broken
Just lean into the crack 
And it will tremble ever so nicely
Notice how it sparkles down there

I can decide what I give
But it’s not up to me
What I get given
Unthinkable surprises about to happen
But what they are

It’s not up to you, well, it never really was
…


(I’ts not up to you - Björk)





There must be a reason for all of this
if not then we might as well make the best of it
Anne Karenina and we try our best to be good
Howl by Ginsberg and let our voices be heard
Marshall Mccluin and how should we do it
Kubrick and let our mad vision change the world
William Blake and let us make art for an audience in heaven
Freud and challenge what you know to be true
Joni Mitchell and we’ll skate down the river together
musicians and what is love, will we ever find out?
Poets and we are listening
Phil elverum and I’m also on a dark rock doing nothing
Molly Drake and may your happiness bird come often to visit
Stórval and dance with your suitcase full of money, naïve art and joy
Kjarval and god and the holy in the paintings
hilma af klint and the holy



the studio to me is very important,
you make the space inviting and open, 
creative things will happen, make sure it’s a place you want to spend your time in,
if not, than all of this is for nothing,
the studio is open, come and paint, come play the guitar,
come sit down and tell a story,
come paint on this canvas.



when I talk about god I talk about the spirit, everything that’s in between us, the line between our will and what 
seemes to be already decided for us, but how, and what does that mean?
decided beforehand, flight fright or freeze, past experiences, learned behaviour, auto pilot, childhood memories,
what about the will?
will of who? 
of god? 
of you?
Who’s in control?
what about the soul, the person, the individual,
what about the will of the people, the will of god, the collective dream or goal,
collective consiousness
If you base a decision on a dream…
if you base your decision on a spiritual awakening after a connection with your uncosiousness…
actions based on dreams?
then the dreams as a precursor to our actions.
Films, art and literature talking about the dream or the vision,
what ultimately came true.

the trip and the adventure, to have a story and then, reflection, documentation, archive, art show, life comes before art,
art and life sometimes being one and the same, 
maybe Fluxus had it right with their situations, happenings and something spontant, emphasis on the unexpexted.

Who are we to think we are in total control of what happens, our art and ideas beyond our control, 
Rothko in his grave thinking about students seeing his paintings in a dimly lit room from a projector, 
outsider artists in their grave, perhaps peacfully, outside all of this western rational, theory and history,
early humans in their grave who existed before there was a word for art, who painted on the walls or made pottery, peacfully,




if we can we should highlight those who,
dared to challenge, dared to live, dared to be kind, dared to..
so, here is to you;
Hilma af klint, the beats, the poets, philosophers, people with mental illnesses, people with disabilities, 
people suffering from a heartbreak, Phil Elverum, my family, my sister, my friends, old lovers, future lovers, 
Harriet Tubman, Anne Frank, Stórval, Reynir Pétur, Alejandro Jodorowksy, Harmony Korine, Andrei Tarkovsky, 
Ingmar Bergman, Gaspar Noé, Cronenberg, Fellini, 

John Stuart Mill and his ideas on freedom, we are always to question our beliefs, we must imagine the 
strongest arguments against our strongest beliefs,
if not, than your ideas and beliefs are dead words, dead in it’s meaning,
we must be able to talk about and question things for the common belief isn’t always 
rigth or true and who should we trust to censor our speech or way of thinking, why would 
we give that power to anyone and for what reasons?

the art is fluid and misunderstood, 
about half of the conversations being had at all times are probably based on misunderstandings, 
different images pop up, 
Shakespear and “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet.”
vowing to never be romeo again,
only a ‘lover‘

and to whom and what do you mean when you talk about art, art as in... what…

it’s just, maybe, that, art schools and institutions have a way of shaping our way of thinking, being able to rationalize, 
maybe it’s western society, maybe it’s the overrationalization of modern thinking, 
well, what are you gonna do?
I try to focus on nature, life before art, art as the byproduct, art as something sacred, the holy moment, magic, 
the sublime, the spirit
I’ll shine whatever light I have to give.




why would you want to change that into words?
how would this text change into an image or a movie?
Ragged clothes and hands in his pockets, kicking a rock, a boy stumbling about, lost in the city, 
romantic ideas of the perfect getaway to the countryside, will I go alone or is there someone out there? 
We die alone but can I get a girl to kiss me on the nose? 
Can I distinguish the dream from the… the artist going mad for something real,
in his hand, a tiny book, Howl by Allen Ginsberg, am I looking for an angry fix?
am I an angelheaded hipster burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night?
can I find out if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity?

In My Dinner With Andre, Andre talks about how strange it
is how often a doctor will live up to our expectation of how a doctor should look,
artist trying to live up to someones expectations of how an artist should look and behave,
why does the artist sit in the park, drinking beer and playing music,
sexual freedom and fuck all and something bigger than us,
something about the guitar maybe, alchohol or drugs,
artist, the free spirit, the beat, the hippie, the outsider

different from everyone else? we the artist and them, but how so?
the mechanic like a dancer, 
the gardener in a trance,
the butcher dealing with life and death in a way we…
we the typical artist will never even come close to understanding,
but what is a typical artist and what is deling with life and death?






Are you closer to understanding what comes before and after death because you slaughter animals for a living?
Is a priest closer to god then we are?
What is oversaturation and does that apply?
Diminishing returns and novelty, serendipity and mastery,




I feel that I might be happy in your school, 
create, think, make friends, be inspired, inspire, learn, teach,
collaborate, sing, play, tell stories,
in the grander scheme of things, like some people say,
it’s just, it doesen’t really matter,
so why not, the absurdity of doing something, Francis Alys, Sisiphus, Camus,
the boulder goes up the mountain but keeps falling back,
why should we try if we know we are going to fail, 
lessons learned through mistakes,
we keep pushing, we keep on doing something instead of nothing,
Sartre and his prisoner who is born in a cell,
the freedom you possess to move as you please, stretch, breath and moan,
sing, cry, shout and whatever comes to mind, the freedom of just being alive,
at the same time he points out the responsability and the burden of freedom,
you can do anything, better do it right, for the right reasons,
because if nothing really matters and you feel you have a will,
better use it for good, 
in the end, does it matter,
what is this anyway,
should I talk about the surrealists and their free flowing speech,
automatic writing, but how do we know,
language as images like the egyptian hieroglyphs,
what is automatic anyway,
if we think before we do but we dont’t control it, the spirit is channaled through the hand and
the word come out and it’s meaning and message...
did you write this? the holy spirit? what is it? why did you do this? Does it matter?
