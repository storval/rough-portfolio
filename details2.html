                Painting with friends, the moment, the madness, 
                    the stories we try to tell, the language that we have to use in order to be able to paint together,
                        at first it was really challenging, you can paint over 
                            the things you don’t like about what I paint and vice versa,
                                so you trust someone for ereasing or recreating something that you have spent time on,
                            if there is trust and honesty, in a setting that allows for pranks and peace, 
                        tranquility and chaos, then this is one of the most amazing feelings ever.
                there’s no limit on how many can paint at the same time, the same with 
            orchestras or bands, different sizes, different genres, different 
        feelings, but trust and a special language or communication 
    that is beyond words, beyond belief.
