                                       John Cleese talks about, all creativity comes from the unconsiousness,... 
                                                                              it all boils down to 
                                                       getting in playful and relaxed frame,
                             The floor is ready, amps are on, caples and microphones 
           in place, aucoustic instruments scattered around the floor,
    just come and join us, no needed prior musical knowledge, 
 come and play, or just sit with us and enjoy.
"Everything is an instrument" is an event created be me and my 
    friend, where we set up a cosy space with lots of instruments 
         and things to play around with, we invite people to come and do anything, 
            play the spoon drumming on the glass, play the rice in the box, 
               make your own shaker, do whatever.
               For a moment we are all in a trance and everyone 
             resonates, i‘ts amazing how obvious it is that rythm is
         primal when you are in a setting like this, get a 
   lot of people together and start banging on some things 
 and make noises, magically everyone locks onto the groove,
magic? What about groove and feeling? Atmoshphere, connections,
why should we explain it and how,

is there a price to pay for explaining to much, 
  worries and how much should we care,

           The war is over
                So said the speaker with the flight suit on
                    Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
                            So he can advance
                                    Remember when I used to dance
                                            Man, all I want to do is dance
